SO THAT I can find a recipe for a nutritious meal
GIVEN I have a recipe I want to cook,
I ALSO WANT an application that can list the ingredients I need for that recipe and  display them in a shopping list with included nutrition facts and average prices,
SO THAT I know what ingredients I will need to buy while shopping for my meal.
# Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I enter recipe specifications in the search bar, 
THEN I am presented with multiple recipe options related to my given specifications,
