## User Story

```
AS A developer seeking information about what this app does,
I WANT to see a user story and acceptance criteria which clearly explains who will be using this application, what the applications purpose is and all the features the application should contain upon completion,
SO THAT I can know what the purpose of this app is and what I should expect when using the app.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am reading the User Story and Acceptance criteria for this application,
WHEN I read the User Story,
THEN I see the type of user who will most likely be using this application and how the user will use the application.
WHEN I read the Acceptance Criteria,
THEN I see all the criteria the application will include when finished.
